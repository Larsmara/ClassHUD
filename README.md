## ðŸ—‚ Architecture

The addon is organised into lightweight modules:

| File | Responsibility |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `ClassHUD.lua` | Core addon lifecycle, events, saved variables, snapshot management. |
| `ClassHUD_Utils.lua` | Shared helpers for profile access, snapshot lookup, formatting, and aura search. |
| `ClassHUD_Bars.lua` | Anchor frame creation, cast/resource/health bar layout and updates. |
| `ClassHUD_Classbar.lua` | Class-specific special power/segment handling. |
| `ClassHUD_Spells.lua` | Snapshot-driven spell frame creation, cooldown/aura updates, tracked buff bar. |
| `ClassHUD_Options.lua` | Ace3 configuration rebuilt around the snapshot cache. |
| `ClassHUD_SpellSuggestions.lua` | Optional pre-filled spell suggestions (data only). |

### Suggested future structure

To keep modules focused as the addon grows, consider grouping files under folders:

- `core/` for bootstrap (`ClassHUD.lua`, `ClassHUD_Utils.lua`).
- `ui/` for bars, spell frames, and any future UI widgets.
- `config/` for options and suggestion data.
- `modules/` for optional trackers (e.g., interrupt tracker, class-specific extras).

## ðŸ¦´ Todo

- [ ] Add optional sound notifications.
- [ ] Extend spell suggestions for remaining specs.
